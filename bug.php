In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys.  While PHP is quite flexible and often automatically converts strings to integers when used as array keys, this can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully. For instance, consider this code snippet:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["1"] = "one";
$myArray[1] = "one";
$myArray["2"] = "two";
print_r($myArray);
```

You might expect the output to show three elements with keys "1", 1, and "2". However, PHP's type juggling will treat "1" and 1 as the same key, resulting in only two elements. This can be problematic in situations where you're expecting distinct keys based on string vs integer values.
